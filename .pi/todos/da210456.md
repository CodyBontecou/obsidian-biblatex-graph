## Spec

- Scaffold a new Obsidian plugin project (package.json, tsconfig, manifest.json, main.ts, styles.css)
- Use a MarkdownPostProcessor to detect @citekey patterns and make them clickable links that open a corresponding note (e.g. references/citekey.md)
- Handle bracket citation syntax: [@key, p. 26]
- Inject resolved links into metadataCache so citations appear as edges in the Graph view
- Settings tab: citation pattern prefix, reference notes folder path, auto-create note on click if missing
- Add syntax highlighting decorations for citation keys in live preview via a CM6 ViewPlugin
- Use TypeScript, follow Obsidian plugin sample conventions
- Build should work with 'npm run build'
- Write a README.md with install/usage instructions
